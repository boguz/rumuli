Collection of "Scroll Down Icons" animations

## What is Rumuli?
Rumuli is a collection of scroll down icons animations which you can use on your full landing page websites, on your apps or where ever you need to signal your visitors / users that they should scroll down.

## Motivation
I have heard from several people, specially older people, that sometimes it's not clear that they should scroll down to access more content. This happens for example on websites with full width and height landing pages.

I also wanted to learn how GitHub works, so I thought why not start a project where i can have some fun making scroll down icon animation and learn GitHub at the same time...

## How to use
Go to the desires animation's folder here on GitHub and copy the html and css codes. Then you just need to paste it into you own project.

## How can you help?
- You can take a look at the code and help me make it better
- You can give ideas for new animations
- You can code your own animations
- You can share this project (on your blog, website, social media,...)
